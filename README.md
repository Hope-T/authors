# authors
This project utilizes a Graph data structure. Authors exist as vertices, and the program links them together if they have connections (through letters, social media, interviews, etc.). If the user likes Author A, they can search for authors that Author A has influenced, or authors whom Author A was influenced by.

Instructions: Please run the program, noting the output. Type in an author, as spelled in the text file (for example, “C.S. Lewis”). Type in either “I” or “O”. For the matrix implementation, the list is generated by checking the matrix slot for true; for the list implementation, the list is generated by returning the list at the array slot. These are authors that you could read next.
